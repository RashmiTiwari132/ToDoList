# Pre-work - ToDoList

Submitted by: Rashmi Tiwari

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [Partially] User can **successfully add but cannot remove items** from the todo list
* [Y] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [N] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart. Due to some error data is not persisting in a file between app restarts.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [Y] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories: Right now due to some issue with Android Studio's emulator, I am not able to create a gif. But if possible I will upload it later.

## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

**Question 1:** "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

**Answer:** Android app development is based on OOPs approach. So, for performing any action there is a pre-defined or custom method for it. Whereas, in web app development it is loosely connected to OOPs approach.

**Question 2:** "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

**Answer:** Adapter is acts as an intermediary between View and Data Source. It updates the View accordingly whenever there is a change in the dataset.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Initially I started with ListView and found it complicated so moved to RecyclerView. And while trying to persist data between app restarts, the file is getting created but data is not getting saved. So, data doesn't persist between app restart.
